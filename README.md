# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a
script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts
```

1. Run hardhat server

    ```
    npx hardhat node
    ```

2. deploy USDT contract

    ```
   npm run deploy:USDT
    ```
3. deploy Mock Coordinator contract

    ```
    npm run deploy:mock-coordinator
    ```

4. deploy Mock Lottery contract

    ```
    npm run deploy:lottery
    ```
